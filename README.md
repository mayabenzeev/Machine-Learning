IBM Course - Machine Learning with Python
This repository showcases my journey through a comprehensive Machine Learning course, encompassing a broad spectrum of techniques from basic regression models to advanced classification and clustering algorithms.
Highlights include hands-on projects with KNN, decision trees, Logistic Regression, and k-means clustering, implemented using Python's SciPy and scikit-learn libraries. 
Each project demonstrates the ability to build, evaluate, and optimize ML models, underscoring the practical application of theoretical concepts.
